# Deep Learning

This repository contains various projects, experiments, and resources related to deep learning. It is intended for educational purposes, research, and practical application of deep learning concepts using popular frameworks and libraries.

## Contents

- Example deep learning models (classification, regression, etc.)
- Notebooks and scripts for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation
- Experiments with different architectures (CNN, RNN, etc.)
- Utilities and helper functions for model development

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Deekshanaik2004/Deep-Learning.git
   cd Deep-Learning
   ```

2. **Set up your environment:**
   - Install Python (recommended: 3.7+)
   - (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - Install the dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run examples:**
   - Explore the notebooks and scripts in the repository.
   - Each project or experiment contains its own instructions for execution.
